            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Dear reader, in this article I will discuss my time at Desire2Learn 
                (D2L) over the 2023 summer semester. I worked as a full stack developer and really 
                enjoyed my time with the team. My work was interesting, the culture was excellent
                 and I would go back in a heartbeat. As you read on I hope you’ll see why I enjoyed 
                 my time so much. 

 
            </p>
            <h2>
                &lt;About-Desire2Learn/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;D2L is the second largest company I’ve worked at, only second to Phenom which has a slightly larger headcount.
                 D2L has been around for a while, more than 20 years in fact, and as of when I’m writing 
                 this D2L employs nearly 1200 employees and provides services to over 16 million learners. 
                 D2L is most known for its online learning platform, Brightspace which is used by small 
                 classrooms, universities, and everything in between across the world. As a matter of fact,
                  Guelph has its own instance of Brightspace for distributing its course organization online
                  , instead of Brightspace we call it Courselink. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;&emsp;Now Brightspace is pretty neat and all but
                   what’s really cool is D2L's latest product, Wave. Wave is an online professional upskilling 
                   platform built to streamline the process of connecting individuals with universities, colleges,
                    and certification programs <a id="goals"></a>so that they can upgrade their professional self and progress their 
                    careers. Wave only recently became available to businesses in the last three years, whereas
                    Brightspace has been around basically since D2L started over 20 years ago. It’s also 
                    worth mentioning that Wave is only run by one team of ~10 developers, which is where
                     I found myself this term. In comparison, Brightspace consists of many teams each 
                     with a significant number of developers. D2L also recently opened a large office 
                     in the Catalyst building in downtown Waterloo, it’s pretty spectacular and I 
                     really enjoyed the few times I was able to go in person.

            <h2>
                &lt;Goals/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Now that you’ve got the scoop on D2L, Brightspace, and Wave let’s talk 
                about a couple goals I had for the term. Now that it’s my fifth co-op term I feel
                 like I’ve gotten a chance to experiment with lots of different goals over my four 
                 previous terms. This term I opted to go with more of what I would call ‘relaxed’ 
                 goals. I get that part of having goals is that they should be specific, actionable 
                 and measurable which these goals still are. The difference is that in the past I’ve 
                 put my goals pretty far out ahead of me, and occasionally I’ve stressed myself out 
                 trying to achieve them. Therefore this term I wanted to still set good goals which 
                 would help me improve, but I wanted them to be pretty attainable and reasonable. So 
                 let’s talk about the goals I set. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Number one was that I wanted to focus a lot on being a team player.
                     This was a bit of an odd one because part of my goal was specifically 
                     to try and help people on my team learn new things or to help them 
                     solve problems and squish bugs. But I’m just an intern, what do I 
                     know that they don’t? Just kidding, kind of. At this point I feel 
                     like I know a fair bit about web development and so I really wanted 
                     to put my knowledge to work and help lift others around me up.
                    <br />

                </li>
                <li>
                    The next goal was very simple. I wanted to get more exposure to AWS stuff. 
                    Going into the term I knew that Wave was based pretty heavily in AWS infrastructure 
                    so if I could get exposure to multiple AWS services and really start to get an
                     understanding of how everything fits together I felt like that would be very 
                     beneficial for me.

                    <br />

                </li>
                <li>
                    The final goal I had in mind was to get more experience reviewing PRs, 
                    particularly more complicated or large PRs. This has been a goal I’ve had
                     across multiple terms and I put a lot of emphasis on it because I truly 
                     believe it's a pretty<a id="my-job"></a>  different set of skills required to be really good at
                      reviewing someone else’s work. To build these skills up requires practice, 
                      hence me making this one of my goals. 
                    <br />

                </li>
            </ul>           
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Well there you go, those are my goals for the term. Pretty 
                simple and attainable wouldn’t you say? We’ll see. In the following two 
                sections I’ll detail some of the cool stuff I got to do and then we’ll 
                reflect on my goals and see how attainable they really were. 
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>
                &lt;My-Job/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;This is the fun stuff, here you’ll get to see what I actually did for the 
                last four months. First things first, onboarding. It’s a critical piece of the 
                new employee experience and honestly I had a lot of fun with this part. There’s 
                the usual mandatory courses about security and company culture but then I got 
                right into work. One thing I appreciate about my team at D2L and luckily the 
                same goes for all my previous teams at other companies is that they didn’t
                 treat me like an intern. They treated me like any other dev, which is 
                 exactly what I enjoy. Also, during the first week I got paired up with an
                  ‘onboarding buddy’, this person volunteers to get annoyed by the new employee
                   during their first couple weeks on the job. Whether it be technical questions
                    or asking how the coffee machine in the office works, your onboarding buddy 
                    has it covered. In all seriousness having someone who you can shamelessly
                     ask many questions to is super beneficial and really speeds up the learning 
                     and ramp-up process in my opinion. 
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;From here on out I’ll refer to the team I worked with as team ‘Nova’, 
                since that’s the team’s actual name. Nova works in six week ‘sprints’ or 
                ‘product cycles’. The team splits into two smaller teams during this time 
                and each team completes a major change or feature over the course of six weeks.
                 After those six weeks we have two weeks of cooldown. This two week span is dubbed 
                 ‘dragonslayer’, still not totally sure where the name came from. The point of these
                 two weeks is to try and clean up tech debt and work on any cool improvements that 
                 team members thought up during the product cycles.  
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;My first product cycle started a week after I joined. Which was nice because
                 I was able to do my onboarding and then start on a fresh cycle the following 
                 week. My team of five devs decided to call ourselves team ‘unicorn-confetti’. 
                 Not sure where the name came from but we really tried to embody the spirit of 
                 unicorn-confetti. Our task was to implement a new widget that would be present
                  in many parts of Wave. This widget would allow users to easily recommend and 
                  share courses that they planned to take or had already completed with their 
                  peers. Design work was already done so we got off to work right away. My first
                   week was spent doing a lot of reading and watching. Any opportunity to join a 
                   huddle and watch someone explain some code, I was there.  
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;After this week of reading I put up my first PR for a small bug fix. 
                It got accepted and then I hopped into more unicorn-confetti related work.
                I had to add some logic to fire Amplitude (analytics) events when users 
                interacted with the widget in various ways. This was a fun task and I was
                 able to poke around a bit in the frontend and backend of the app. Following 
                 that we got to work on animations. Wave didn’t have animations anywhere else 
                 at the time so this was a fun thing to work on and required lots of experimenting. 
                 The animations that we were using are Lottie animations, and implementing them in 
                 Lit-Elements was a bit of a struggle but we came up with a really clean and 
                 accessible solution that could be reused in other parts of the app quite easily. 
                 We continued developing and eventually got the feature merged right before the
                  product cycle was up. 
            </p>
            <p>
                  &emsp;&emsp;During my first dragonslayer I checked out our team's documents 
                  of stuff that needed to be done. One of the things listed under ‘engineering goals’ 
                  was to create some strategy around frontend state management. That sounded pretty 
                  up my ally so to speak. So I spent a couple afternoons building out some documentation 
                  about what I thought of our frontend state management at the moment and what I thought 
                  could be done to improve it. State is a big deal in React but since the team uses Lit,
                   everything looked a little bit different despite many of the principles being the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;I stirred up some discussion over the frontend and during the two week cooldown
                 I was able to create a plan for how we would improve the frontend, I 
                 really enjoyed this and felt like I was doing something significant in regards
                  to making positive change for the team. 
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;I’ll try and speed this up a bit since I’ve already typed out so many words but here
             I was, ready to start the next product cycle. This time I got placed on team ‘fire’ who was 
             responsible for removing a bunch of old code in order to clean up the logic for features which
              would be coming in future product cycles. This time the team name made sense, fire, cleaning 
              up code, setting it on fire. Okay, maybe it doesn’t make complete sense because removing 
              code is much more technical than just setting it on fire. I think it makes more sense than
               unicorn-confetti but what do I know? Anyhow, I did just that. I spent most of the cycle 
               removing code. It was an interesting experience and gave me a unique perspective on how
                much thought is required to remove a small bit of logic within a large system without 
                screwing something somewhere else up. Towards the end of this cycle we wrapped up the 
                code removal a tad bit early so I spent some more time working on the frontend state management docs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;During the final week of the cycle I got to become the ‘supernova’. For comedic purposes 
        I was tempted to leave that sentence without an explanation but I guess you might actually be 
        curious what the heck a ‘supernova’ is in this context. Well, Wave does weekly deployments to 
        prod. Usually on Tuesdays. One person every week is the designated supernova, this person is 
        essentially an on call dev whose only focus is to ensure Wave is up and running and that the 
        deployment goes smoothly, this person is also in charge of resolving any day to day support 
        tickets and issues that are beyond the capabilities of our admins/support members. Since 
        this week tends to be pretty hectic, the supernova becomes the ‘neutron star’ in the week 
        following their supernova shift. As a neutron star, your days are much slower paced and you
         tend to work on a specific backlog of items that need to be cleaned up and that are suitable
          for one person to do over the course of a week. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;So yeah, that’s basically how those two weeks went. I got to release Wave V50.5.0 and 
    proceeded to do a handful of hotfixes during the week. This was the largest quantity of PRs that 
    the team had ever had in a release so there were a few rocky days during the week but all in all
     it went pretty smoothly. I don’t think many interns anywhere get to run a weekly production 
     deployment. It’s certainly a unique experience that I was very fortunate to have. Make no mistake, 
     it took a lot of hard work over the term to prove to my manager that I was capable of such responsibility. 
     I'm glad that the work paid off and that I was able to have this experience.

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;That was more or less the gist of what I did at D2L. I skipped on quite 
                a few details for the sake of brevity but trust that I learned and did a lot at D2L
                 and that my time here was truly an incredible opportunity. 
        <section>
            <h2>
                &lt;Reflections/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Now that you’re up to speed with what exactly I did over the last 
                four months lets go look at those goals I talked about many paragraphs ago. 
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;My first goal related to be a better team player. This was honestly
                 really easy to achieve and I’d like to attribute it primarily to my team’s culture.
                  Everyone on the team was incredibly easy going and open to help. This made it easy
                   for me to find the help I needed when I needed it but it also gave me the chance 
                   to easily help others when they needed it. Overall, I was really happy with this 
                   goal as I sort of achieved it naturally due to the way my team was set up. The 
                   next goal was to get more exposure to AWS tech. I think I crushed this goal. I 
                   got to play with all sorts of stuff. Messing around in Dynamo, exploring traffic 
                   and logs in our Lambdas, replaying events in our SQS dead letter queue. There’s 
                   so many areas of AWS that I didn’t even know existed that the team uses. 
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   &emsp;&emsp;The most exposure I got was during my time as supernova because I was 
                   constantly on the lookout for alarms and trying to understand why and how something
                    was breaking. This typically required me to navigate multiple AWS services to 
                    resolve a problem, and once I got the hang of it I felt great. AWS was a very 
                    daunting thing in the past and now that I have some knowledge of it I’m excited 
                    to see what my future work with AWS will entail. Finally my last goal was to 
                    review large and more complicated PRs. This goal was actually really hard to 
                    achieve, and I would say I missed on this one. The reason it was hard to achieve
                     is that the team does such a good job of breaking down tasks and tickets that no
                      PR was ever so significant that it seemed intimidating. Everyone usually left 
                      steps on how to test their PR as well as a short explanation of their changes.
                       The PRs that I had to review this term were some of the easiest to understand 
                       and review that I’ve ever seen primarily because they were so well divided and
                        documented. All in, I’m pretty happy with how my goals turned out despite missing
                         the mark on the last one. In hindsight perhaps I should have modified the goal 
                         to better fit my environment, that’s something for me to consider in the future.

                &emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, I had an amazing time at D2L working on team Nova. 
                Wave is an incredible product and I can’t wait to see it succeed in the coming 
                years. My team was fantastic and I can’t get over how friendly and welcoming 
                everyone was. I truly felt right at home with this team. Over the last four
                 months I learned a lot, laughed a lot, and hope that someday I’ll find my 
                 way back to the offices of D2L.
